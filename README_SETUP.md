# Setup Instructions

To update the project to the latest Lovable version and enable enhanced ML features, please follow these steps:

## Quick Setup

1. First, make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   bash chmod.sh
   ```

2. Run the dependency fix script:
   ```bash
   ./fix-deps.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Install all required dependencies including React, TypeScript, Vite
   - Install Lovable Tagger for enhanced development features
   - Install all Radix UI components and utility libraries
   - Set up enhanced ML model dependencies
   
3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
